# Chat_ScreenShot_Classifier
This convolutional neural network can predict if an input image is a chat screen-shot or a normal image. I have trained the model on 527 training images and tested on 132 test images. After 5 epochs it reached a training set accuracy more than 99% and a test set accuracy more than 97%. 

# Motivation : 
I have a couple of friends who send me a lot of chat screen-shots. Gradually my phone gallery became filled with them. So I thought it would be nice if I can make a model which can seperate the chat screen-shots from other images for me :P 

# Try yourself :
Download the model from : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k99ndVPuxI3kDGs6or2rSUWPC5LSjF-9

Save the model in same the directory where you saved the two *.py* files.

Pass the path of your image in **load_image()** function in line **21** of the file *load model and predict.py*  Have fun!
